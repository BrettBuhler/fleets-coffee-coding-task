        <p class="description-p"><b>Task:</b> Write a function called firstNonRepeated that takes a single string s as input and returns the first non-repeated character in the string. If there is no non-repeated character, return an empty string.</p>
        <p class="description-p">Input: A string s containing lowercase and/or uppercase English letters.</p>
        <p class="description-p">Output: A string representing the first non-repeated character in the input string or an empty string if there is no non-repeated character.</p>
        <p class="description-p">Example:</p>
        <p class="description-p">firstNonRepeated("hello") => "h"</p>

        <h2 id="description-title">Description:</h2>
        <p class="description-p">When I was tasked with finding the first non-repeated character in a given string, I initially came up with a naive solution that did not have a time complexity of O(n). My initial approach involved looping through the input string twice.</p>
        <p class="description-p">However, I realized that I could improve the time complexity of my solution by only looping through the string once. I implemented a strategy that involved maintaining two objects. The first object would hold non-repeating characters and the second repeating characters. During each iteration through the string, I checked if the current character existed in either of the two objects. If it did not exist in either object, I added it to the non-repeated object. If it existed in the non-repeated object, I removed it and added it to the repeated object. My strategy allowed me to track non-repeated characters in real-time and retrieve the first non-repeated character at the end of the loop.</p>
        <p class="description-p">Overall, my final solution has a time complexity of O(n), which is much more efficient than my initial approach.</p>
        <p class="description-p">I hope this challenge showcases my desire to deliver results that exceed expectations.</p>
